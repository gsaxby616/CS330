Project Reflection
How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I begin by identifying user needs and system requirements. I break down the overall problem into smaller, manageable components and focus on the architecture before diving into development. For this project, I aimed to create a realistic and interactive 3D scene based on my personal desk setup. I consistently strive to balance functionality with usability, ensuring that my designs meet both technical specifications and user experience goals.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project helped me strengthen my 3D spatial reasoning and develop a deeper understanding of camera control in OpenGL. I implemented panning, zooming, and orbiting camera movements using keyboard and mouse inputs, which greatly enhanced the interactivity of the scene. I also improved my knowledge of coordinate systems, transformations, and perspective projections, which are crucial for creating believable and navigable 3D environments.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

I followed an iterative design process throughout the project. Starting with a basic outline of the key objects like the desk, monitors, and accessories, I gradually refined each element. Frequent testing of the camera controls and object placements allowed me to adjust the scene layout for a more natural and immersive experience. This feedback-driven approach ensured that my design improved continuously as the project progressed.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The iterative, feedback-based design approach I used here is something I plan to carry into future projects. Breaking down complex problems into stages, testing frequently, and staying flexible enough to adjust along the way is a reliable strategy for producing high-quality results. Additionally, prioritizing user interaction, such as intuitive camera controls, will continue to be a key element in any software I design, whether it’s for simulations, games, or data visualization tools.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach program development with a focus on planning, modularity, and testing. I outline the core functionality, break it into smaller modules, and progressively build each part. Testing individual components before integrating them into the larger system allows me to catch issues early and maintain stability. In this project, I prioritized developing the core scene objects first, then worked on implementing camera control, and finally optimized the rendering process.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

One of the new development strategies I implemented in this project was integrating user input for real-time camera control. This involved handling keyboard inputs (WASD/QE) for movement and mouse inputs for orbiting and zooming. It was my first time combining OpenGL transformations with real-time user controls in this way, and it significantly improved the project’s interactivity. I also gained experience working with vertex buffers and shaders to optimize rendering performance.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration played a crucial role in my development process. I frequently tested camera movements, adjusted view and projection matrices, and refined object placements based on how the scene felt during navigation. This continuous loop of building, testing, and refining helped me create a more polished and immersive experience. Iteration allowed me to address problems as they arose and make informed adjustments along the way.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

Throughout the milestones, my approach to developing code became more structured and efficient. Early on, I focused on understanding the core concepts like setting up shaders and loading objects into the scene. As I progressed, I improved at modularizing my code, separating camera logic from rendering logic, and debugging OpenGL errors more effectively. I became more comfortable with matrix transformations and real-time user input handling, which allowed me to implement more advanced features confidently.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science provides me with the skills to analyze problems, design solutions, and implement efficient systems, all of which are vital for my career goals. As I prepare to become a Naval officer with an engineering background, these skills will help me in areas such as simulation modeling, system analysis, and decision support tools. The problem-solving mindset and technical expertise fostered by computer science are applicable across a wide range of domains and will be crucial for my success.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

In my educational journey, especially in simulation and modeling coursework, computational graphics give me the tools to represent data visually, making complex systems easier to understand and analyze. The skills I’ve developed in 3D rendering, transformations, and interactive environments will enhance my ability to create effective visual aids and simulations for projects, presentations, and research.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Professionally, these skills are valuable for creating training simulations, visual data analysis tools, and interactive systems. In military and engineering contexts, being able to model scenarios visually can improve decision-making, planning, and communication. For example, I could use these skills to build visualization tools for equipment maintenance procedures or to simulate naval operations for training purposes. Computational graphics and visualizations provide a powerful means of conveying information and creating immersive learning environments.
